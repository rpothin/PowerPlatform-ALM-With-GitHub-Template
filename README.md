## 📢 What is the PowerPlatform-ALM-With-GitHub-Template project?

It is a **GitHub repository** that can be easily used as a starting point to create your own repository for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.

It contains components (GitHub workflows, PowerShell scripts...) that will help you have a healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 applications using GitHub.

## 🚀 Goals

1. Provide an easy way to setup a GitHub repository for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.
2. Propose a starting point allowing a development team to customize the included components based on their own needs.
3. Illustrate that we can automate many things related to the Power Platform to support an healthy ALM strategy.
4. Be a complement to the work done around ALM in other repositories like [coe-starter-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit) and [coe-alm-accelerator-templates](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates).
5. Show that a [trunk-based development approach](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) can be applied to Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.
6. Be an inspiration for the Power Platform & Dynamics 365 communities regarding using GitHub to support open-source projects that could benefit others.

### Non-goals

1. Be the best "solution" for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development using GitHub - *our expectations are high regarding the quality of the solution we will propose, but we will always support other similar projects, initiatives or ideas*.
2. Cover all the aspects of Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development - *it is a really long-term goal and I ([@rpothin](https://github.com/rpothin)) don't think I will be able to achieve it alone*.
