## üì¢ What is the PowerPlatform-ALM-With-GitHub-Template project?

It is a **GitHub repository** that can be easily used as a starting point to create your own repository for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.

It contains components (GitHub workflows, PowerShell scripts...) that will help you have a healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 applications using GitHub.

## üöÄ Goals

1. Provide an easy way to setup a GitHub repository for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.
2. Propose a starting point allowing a development team to customize the components included based on their own needs.
3. Illustrate that we can automate many things related to the Power Platform to support a healthy ALM strategy.
4. Be a complement to the work done around ALM in other repositories like [coe-starter-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit) and [coe-alm-accelerator-templates](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates).
5. Show that a [trunk-based development approach](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) can be applied to Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development.
6. Be an inspiration for the Power Platform & Dynamics 365 communities regarding using GitHub to support open-source projects that could benefit others. 

### Non-goals

1. Be the best "solution" for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development using GitHub - *our expectations are high regarding the quality of the solution we will propose, but we will always support other similar projects or ideas*.
2. Cover all the aspects of Power Platform / Dynamics 365 development - *it could be a really long-term goal but I ([@rpothin](https://github.com/rpothin)) will definitely not be able to do that alone*.
